# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss the merits and the drawbacks of increasing data privacy. Two articles with different viewpoints on the issue of data privacy will be compared. 

## Article 1
In Time's [The Problem With Too Much Data Privacy](https://time.com/6224484/data-privacy-problem/), Professor Orly Lobel from the University of San Diego claims that privacy is indeed important when people are at risk of harmful surveillance, but prohibiting safe data collection may conflict with values of a democratic society that are equally important as privacy. At the time of publication, Congress was facing a bill that would further privacy of data. The author argues that this increase in privacy can threaten the benefits of using information for positive change, just as too little privacy can do the same. 

While it is reasonable for people to fear surveillance when it is utilized as a means for dangerous actions, this is not to say that all data collection is harmful. The author supports regulating the misuse of data that has been collected rather than banning collection altogether. Surveillance and facial recognition have benefits in arenas such as protection from domestic violence and human trafficking, and assisting those with disabilities.

Furthermore, over-obsession with privacy can threaten the acquisition of representative data so that algorithms can be more accurate and be characterized by reduced bias. Data is necessary to develop more accurate diagnoses so excessive privacy may hinder scientific research. This article suggests that a careful approach should be taken when collecting data, acknowledging the benefits while also addressing potential concerns.

## Article 2
In comparison to Lobel's argument, Jacqueline Lipton's [Why We Should All Be Concerned About Digital Privacy](https://www.ucpress.edu/blog/60226/why-we-should-all-be-concerned-about-digital-privacy/), published by the University of California Press argues that, because the United States Constitution or government does not expressly protect privacy, citizens themselves must take steps to protect their own personal data or else face the risks of unwanted intrusions into personal information. 

While consumers may see benefits in targeted advertising by companies like Amazon or Netflix, these consumer suggestions can lead to discrimination in areas such as education, housing, employment, and law enforcement. While people consider privacy to be an important quality in their lives, the lack of education on the government's failure to secure privacy contributes to the comodification of private information, where individuals give away large pieces of personal information in exchange for, for example, small discounts through loyalty programs. These same sets of data can be used to target political messages to sympathetic groups and risks of data manipulation in politics rises. 

Protecting personal data is essential, according to the author, because of the United States' lack of clear privacy rights. Therefore, increasing education on the topic is essential.
